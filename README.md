Rkvatfallback adds extra check services to the VIES check 
of Magento by extending the Customer Helper.

Warning: Since all of the free VIES API's are slow and 
somewhat unreliable the checkout steps could become slow while checking.

Tested on Mage CE 1.7 & 1.8

[0.1.0] Added the EU VIES site and http://isvat.appspot.com/ as fallback APIs
